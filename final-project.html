				<p id = "body">
				I found out that user research is a necessary process. These researches help me to collect requirements and necessary functions of a website in a very short time. Moreover, it helps with construct and design a brief view of the website, saving many times in design level. 

<br><br>After I finish the basic construction of the website I conducts user testing to figure out how current website satisfied users. I found out that various users having various requirements and asking for different information from me. Sometimes they prefer media elements rather than long paragraphs introducing.

<br><br>The website that I created is too plain and simple, while users want to see more information related to my life and my professional experience. 
				</p><br>

				<h1 id = "maintitle">Incorporation of Findings</h1>
				
				<div class="info-box-a">
				<p id = "body">
				

In order to putting more element into the website, I spent a great amount of time in researching how to integrating media elements. I also separated my personal interests from the work experience and professional skills to satisfy different viewers. 

<br><br>In the future I might try to add some icons which relink to social media websites rather than keep users contact me only through email. Since the interviews states that they also want to connect me through social media, I will try to make the functions work in the next designing stage. </p><br>
